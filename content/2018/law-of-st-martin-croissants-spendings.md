On centenary of Polish independence, I noticed that my spendings on *rogale świętomarcińskie* (St. Martin Croissants) follow peculiar pattern.

November 11th is Polish National Independence Day. Here in Poznań we don't care nearly as much as we do about *rogale świętomarcińskie*, a local cake (see [post from 2015 for details and background]({filename}../2015/plotting-bakeries-certified-to-sell-st-martin-croissants.md)). Of course I did buy some.

Out of sheer curiosity, I wanted to see how much I spent on croissants in previous years. Here's the plot of data from 2014 (2017 is missing because I wasn't in Poznań then):

[![Plot of St. Martin Croissants spendings; 2014: 7.2 PLN, 2015: 15 PLN, 2016: 30.98 PLN, 2018: 60.02 PLN](

My spendings follow exponential distribution almost perfectly, doubling every time I do buy them. I dread the next year.

title: What's in a name?
hidden: True

My legal name is Mirosław Długosz-Zalewski, but I go by Mirek Długosz (Dlugosz)

It's pronounced [[ˈmɪrɛk](https://forvo.com/word/mirek/) [ˈdwuɡɔʂ](https://forvo.com/word/d%C5%82ugosz/)]. It sounds something like "Me - wreck D'lugosh".

"Mirek" is diminutive of "Mirosław". It's the same name, just little easier to pronounce and write.

I'm always happy to talk about testing, open source, software engineering and related topics.

If you want to discuss any of my work, I want to talk with you.
If you want to discuss any of **your** work, I want to talk with you.
If you are looking for software, book or career recommendation, I want to talk with you.
If you have a software, book or blog recommendation, I want to hear it.

I don't expect anything in exchange, but I can't promise more than little bit of my time and attention. I think world is a better place when it's not only about money.

You can reach me through channels listed below. I strongly prefer email.

I'm Mirek DÅ‚ugosz ([pronunciation]({filename}/pages/name-pronunciation.md)). I'm a software engineer and I specialize in testing.

My work primarily revolves around automation, web (both frontend and backend) and data processing. My language of choice is Python, but I'm also comfortable in JavaScript, PHP, R and bash.

I maintain my professional [CV / resume on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirekdlugosz/en). While I am not looking for full time employment, I am available for commissioned work.

I've been passionate about open source since I first heard about it, back in 2005. In the past, I have contributed translations and QA work for Debian, KDE and LibreOffice. These days I mostly contribute code. Most of my work happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/mirekdlugosz).

I have started few open source projects, too. You can read more about them on [Projects page]({filename}/pages/projects.md).

Between discovering open source and getting hired as a software engineer, I pursued master's degree in sociology. I rounded it off with a bachelor degree in computer science couple of years later. I firmly believe that "Methodology of Sciences" is the most professionally relevant class I have ever taken.

## Open invitation

I'm always happy to talk about testing, open source, software engineering and related topics.

If you want to discuss any of **your** work, I want to talk with you.

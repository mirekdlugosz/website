I am [Mirek Długosz]({filename}/pages/whats-in-a-name.md) - software tester and open source enthusiast.

My goal is to go beyond what's simple and obvious. I'm constantly looking for ways to deepen my knowledge and sharpen my skills. I got my master's degree in sociology. Currently I work at Red Hat, where I spread knowledge about skilled testing and challenge my own technical abilities.

I live in Poznań, Poland.

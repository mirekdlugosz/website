title: About me

I got my master degree in sociology, I am currently working as software quality assurance engineer and I am hobbyist data scientist. 
You can read more in my [professional business card/résumé](/).
There are also links to my content on various social sites on your right.

On this blog I share things that I have learned about. 
Since I am mostly focused on learning data scientists toolset, this is kind of things you might expect.
Because I am involved in various open source projects, opinion pieces might be published every now and then.

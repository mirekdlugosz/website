In my [Association for Software Testing 2023 elections proceedings](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/about-the-ast-a-professional-body-for-testers/board-of-directors/election-proceedings/2023-election/2023-election-mirek-dlugosz/) I advocated for transparency. In the spirit of practising what I preach, this blog post summarizes my work for AST in November 2023.

* Offboarded some of previous Board of Directors members. Thank you for your service and I hope to see you around!
* Created runbook for Google organization changes needed when onboarding and offboarding Board of Directors members. This is internal only and I can't link to this.
* Planned phone.com migration. I got clear understanding what exactly needs to be done and decided how to approach that. The migration itself has not yet started.
* Created new shared calendar for Board of Directors events. We'll see if it's actually useful. Can't link to it, again.
* Tried, and failed, to move from shared Google Drive folder to Google Drive Shared Drive.
* Fixed Zapier connection with LinkedIn, documented the procedure in runbook for Social Media content automation.

The biggest thing this month was supposed to be a migration from Google Drive folder to Shared Drive.

When I tried to make a move, Google told me there are too many files owned by people from outside of Association for Software Testing organization. This is fair enough. What Google did not tell me is that ownership can't be transferred between organizations. That means that if there are files owned by `someone@gmail.com`, these files can be owned by `someone.else@gmail.com`, but will never be owned by `someone.else@associationforsoftwaretesting.org`.

Apparently, this is somewhat common problem. What's strange is that there is no good solution. The only way I know of is downloading entire shared folder and then uploading it again under different account. But this loses all metadata - who created a file, when, and entire editing history. It's also slow and, depending on how you approach it, potentially error-prone.

I have created an internal document listing all the problems I have faced, and also explaining the benefits of adopting Shared Drive. I hope we can still make a transition one day in the future. Until then, we will at least have better idea what exactly we need to look out for.

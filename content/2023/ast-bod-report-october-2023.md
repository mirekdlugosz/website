In my [Association for Software Testing 2023 elections proceedings](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/about-the-ast-a-professional-body-for-testers/board-of-directors/election-proceedings/2023-election/2023-election-mirek-dlugosz/) I advocated for trasparency. In the spirit of practising what I preach, this blog post summarizes my work for AST in October 2023.

* Configured Google reCAPTCHA for contact plugin on the website. We use [Contact Form 7](https://contactform7.com/), and since version 5.8.1 it complains about "unsafe emails without protection" in specific configurations. Adding reCAPTCHA silences the complaint.
* Finished runbook for asking for CAST presentation slides. This is internal only and I can't link to this, sorry. This wraps up a project to build [a database of all the presentations and slide decks used at AST events](https://github.com/associationforsoftwaretesting/presentations), something I started back in February.
* Created a runbook for pitfalls to look out for when creating a new newsletter. Again, this is internal only.
* Preparing the field for transition from shared Google Drive directory to shared Drive. I mostly learned about pros and cons of each and differences between these two. I also created new shared Drive to get some hands-on experience. I hope the transition will happen in November.
* Monthly Board of Directors meeting.
* Some internal Slack discussions and reviewing work of other people.

I'd say that was not bad for a first month! Let's keep this momentum going.

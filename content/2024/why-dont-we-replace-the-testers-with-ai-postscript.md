When researching [my previous article]({filename}why-dont-we-replace-the-testers-with-ai.md), I stumbled upon [an essay by Dave Karpf titled "Two Failure Modes of Emerging Technologies"](https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/two-failure-modes-of-emerging-technologies).

The first failure mode is when the technology is actually successful, finds itself used outside of planned context and that causes a whole swath of unintended consequences. Second - technology fails to deliver what it promised, but _still_ finds itself widely used and incorporated into critical systems. Everyone learns to works around problems, or worse - stops to see there are problems to begin with.

Most of AI critique falls closer to the first mode of failure. My article is no different - my main argument is that AI will not get as good as it needs to be to replace testers anytime soon.

But if I were taking bets, my money would be on AI following the second mode of failure - it will not live up to it's hype, and still get widely deployed.

It's unfortunate I did not spend more time reflecting on this.

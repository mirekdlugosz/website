The Association for Software Testing yearly election process has started. We are looking for three people to join the Board.

[Official announcement on AST site has all the details, including dates and formal requirements](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/2024/07/01/ast-nominations-are-open/).

If you aren't sure if you would be a good fit, you have any questions about the Board, Association or the elections, or you are looking for someone from within the organization to support your nomination, I am more than happy to help - just [reach out using the usual channels]({filename}../pages/contact.md).

And if you can't run for election because you are not a member yet, now is the perfect time to join - just in time to meet formal requirements for the next year. Head on to ["Become a Member" page on AST website](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/about-the-ast-a-professional-body-for-testers/membership/become-a-member-of-the-the-association-for-software-testing/).

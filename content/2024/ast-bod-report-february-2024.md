In my [Association for Software Testing 2023 elections proceedings](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/about-the-ast-a-professional-body-for-testers/board-of-directors/election-proceedings/2023-election/2023-election-mirek-dlugosz/) I advocated for transparency. In the spirit of practising what I preach, this blog post summarizes my work for AST in February 2024.

* Fixed a problem where email sent to Group is not distributed to all members of that Group. Google support was not particularly helpful, although I must note that there was actual human involved, and she did try. A fix involved changing the way our Wordpress site is sending emails. Documented everything internally.
* Pushed Phone.com migration (see [previous report]({filename}ast-bod-report-january-2024.md)). Wrote down all cost saving opportunities and action items, assigned these to other Board members. Not all items are resolved yet.
* Fixed a [BBST Graduates list page](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/bbst-black-box-software-testing-courses/graduates/). There were some strange things in HTML that caused Wordpress to parse it badly, and in turn it displayed all wrong.
* Fixed a problem of periodic posts on LinkedIn displaying black box instead of YouTube video preview.
* Updated internal dictionary / documentation of shared email accounts
* Monthly Board of Directors meeting.

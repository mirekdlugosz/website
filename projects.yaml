    Kustosz is [feed reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator)
    with the goal of helping you to focus on worthwhile content. I
    wrote separate [announcement post](/blog/2022/announcing-kustosz/)
    that explores its unique features and my motivation.

    I created backend while a friend of mine created frontend. Later I revamped
    frontend, too. I also created website and documentation. Everything
    is plugged into CI pipeline, making new releases almost fully
    automatic. There's installer and container image.

    Kustosz is now the primary way I read online content.

    Web application that helps you build your own Pokémon team in any core
    series game. There's an [announcement post](/blog/2018/why-i-love-pokemon/)
    that covers history of the project and my relationship with the franchise.

    It became a little popular among Pokémon fans, attracting around 3000 users
    each month and spawning a small discussion on reddit.

    [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) plugin that generates images to make
    your posts more visually appealing on social media. This is the result of
    scratching my own itch, as I explained in [announcement
    post](/blog/2021/automatic-offline-twitter-card-images-og-image-generator-for-static-sites/).
    I still believe there's a space for similar project that could be 
    distributed as a single binary.

    Graphical application that creates [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) post
    metadata. I like static website generators for many reasons, but I also
    like safety net provided by CMS. I'm irrationally anxious about creating
    spurious categories through typos, and I created this tool to make sure it
    never happens.

    R Shiny application to explore changes in civic engagement index in various
    European countries over time. It embodies my whole self, existing on
    intersection of software engineering, data analysis and sociology. It was
    created back when when everyone talked about data science and I considered
    a career in the field.

  description: |
    Ansible playbook to deploy some of my configuration files and install
    utilities that are rarely packaged by distributions. I appreciate the new
    generation of command-line utilities, but I routinely work on two-three
    machines and I can't afford to wonder if tool is available and up-to-date.
    Thanks to this project, I don't have to.

    It was created during Red Hat Day of Learning, which is a day that I get paid
    to learn something new, not necessarily related to my daily work. It's a great
    benefit.

    My first thematic blog, focused on LibreOffice tips and tricks. Now
    discontinued, but I keep it online. It was relatively popular in Polish
    open source and academic communities, attracting about 20 000 unique
    visitors in peak months.
